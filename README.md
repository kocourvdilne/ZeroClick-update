# ZeroClick-update
ZeroClick and its possibilities with the Dragon Burner tool head, new switch and probe options in the automatic servo dock.
I'm starting from the basic version here:https://github.com/zruncho3d/ZeroClick and https://www.printables.com/model/640054-zeroclick-servo-dock
I changed the original version as follows:
1) The probe holder is now on the Dragon Burner tool head
2) the probe that was originally on the D2F microswitch is now new (probe1.stl) this one supports the D2HW-A201D microswitch (the advantage is less pressure of the probe on the bed)
3) newly redesigned dock for probe with D2HW-A201D micro switch
I will gradually add macros and probe wiring.
